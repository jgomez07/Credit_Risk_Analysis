## Summary
After analyzing various statistical modals for determining credit risk, it is appearent from the results that the Easy Emsemble is the best model to utilize. The resulting accuracy rate was 93% and the F1 scores were above o.9. On the other hand, the F1 score are low for high_risk it has high recall meaning a very low number of false negatives.
